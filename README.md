# task_manager_api
building a RESTful API for a simple task management application. The application should allow users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. Each task should have a title, description, status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed), and a due date. Additionally, users should be able to register, log in, and associate tasks with their accounts.
